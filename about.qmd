## 👋 Hi, I’m Nhat

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics (MSBA) at Boston University, focusing on applying data to understand markets and inform decision-making. My earlier studies in Economics and Finance at Drexel University sparked my interest in how numbers reveal the stories behind business trends.

Through projects in predictive modeling, marketing analytics, NLP, and data visualization, I have developed the ability to translate technical analysis into practical, real-world insights.
