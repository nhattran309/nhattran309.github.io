    "##### Provide an example that explains why someone might care about resampling a time series.\n",
    "A retail analyst tracking daily sales at a chain of toy stores can see a lot of fluctuations in the raw data. Resampling the data into weekly or monthly averages makes it easier to compare different periods, such as the holiday season or Black Friday versus regular months. For example, December and the week of Black Friday consistently show higher average sales than other months, helping the business plan inventory, staffing, and promotions more effectively. By smoothing out daily noise, resampling provides a clearer picture of these seasonal patterns and supports smarter operational decisions."
